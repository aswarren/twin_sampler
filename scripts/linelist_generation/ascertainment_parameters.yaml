# COVID-19 Ascertainment Probability Model Parameters
# This file specifies the parameters for a model that calculates the probability of
# a SARS-CoV-2 infection being officially ascertained (i.e., diagnosed and reported).
# The model is based on a severity gradient, with base probabilities modified by
# demographic, socioeconomic, geographic, and clinical factors.
# Each parameter is justified with citations from the accompanying bibliography.

ascertainment_parameters:
  base_probabilities:
    # Base probabilities are stratified by the clinical severity of the infection.
    # This reflects the fundamental bias of surveillance systems toward more severe disease.
    asymptomatic:
      probability: 0.05
      sources: [1, 2, 13]
      # Justification: The ascertainment of asymptomatic cases via standard, passive
      # surveillance is extremely low. This is inferred from two key lines of evidence.
      # First, screening studies (proactive testing) detect nearly double the rate of
      # asymptomatic infections compared to non-screening studies (symptom-driven testing),
      # suggesting passive systems miss a large fraction.[1, 13] Second, the
      # overall Infection Ascertainment Ratio (IAR) for all infections is 15-40%.[2]
      # Given that severe cases are nearly 100% ascertained, the probability for the
      # large asymptomatic pool must be in the low single digits to maintain this average.
      # A value of 0.05 represents a small but non-zero chance of detection, primarily
      # through contact tracing or targeted screening programs.
    mild_to_moderate_symptomatic:
      probability: 0.30
      sources: [2, 3, 5]
      # Justification: This category represents the bulk of community infections and is
      # the primary driver of the overall IAR, which is estimated to be 15-40%.[2]
      # The value of 0.30 is chosen as the midpoint of this empirically derived range,
      # representing an average ascertainment level across different phases of the pandemic.
      # This value acknowledges that while symptomatic individuals are more likely to be
      # tested than asymptomatic ones, a majority are still not officially recorded due to
      # barriers to testing, mildness of symptoms not prompting care-seeking, or other
      # factors.[3, 5]
    severe_hospitalized:
      probability: 0.98
      sources: [2, 3]
      # Justification: The probability of ascertaining a severe case is near unity.
      # Severe illness is typically defined by outcomes requiring hospitalization or
      # intensive care. This clinical state, by its nature, guarantees interaction with
      # the healthcare system, where diagnostic testing is standard procedure.[3]
      # The proportion of underdiagnosed severe cases is considered negligible.[2]
      # The value of 0.98 reflects this near-certainty while allowing for the remote
      # possibility of a case being missed (e.g., death at home without testing).

  modifiers:
    # Modifiers are multiplicative factors that adjust the base probabilities based on
    # individual characteristics. The final probability is calculated as:
    # P(Ascertained) = P_base * M_age * M_ses * M_geo * M_comorbidity
    age:
      # Age is a primary driver of both clinical severity and the likelihood of
      # asymptomatic infection, making it a powerful modifier of ascertainment.
      "0-17":
        multiplier: 0.60
        sources: [4, 5]
        # Justification: Children and adolescents have the highest proportion of
        # asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections, peaking at 13.5 years of age.[4]
        # Milder illness and asymptomaticity are directly associated with decreased
        # testing and case-finding in younger age groups.[5] This multiplier
        # adjusts the probability downward to account for this systemic under-ascertainment.
      "18-49":
        multiplier: 1.00
        sources: [6]
        # Justification: This group serves as the baseline reference for adult
        # hospitalization data provided by public health agencies like the CDC.[6]
        # Its multiplier is set to 1.0 by definition.
      "50-64":
        multiplier: 1.20
        sources: [4, 6]
        # Justification: This group has a lower proportion of asymptomatic infections
        # than younger adults [4] and experiences a notable increase in hospitalization
        # rates (2.9 times higher than the 18-49 baseline).[6] The multiplier
        # reflects this moderately increased likelihood of a detectable outcome.
      "65-74":
        multiplier: 1.80
        sources: [4, 6]
        # Justification: Hospitalization rates increase substantially in this age group
        # (7.3 times higher than baseline).[6] The probability of an infection being
        # asymptomatic continues to decrease with age.[4] The large multiplier
        # reflects the sharply increased probability of an infection progressing to a
        # severe, high-ascertainment state.
      "75+":
        multiplier: 2.50
        sources: [4, 6]
        # Justification: This group experiences an exponential increase in hospitalization
        # risk (24.1 times higher than baseline) [6] and has the lowest proportion
        # of asymptomatic infections.[4] The modifier is set to a high value to
        # capture the extreme likelihood that an infection in this demographic will
        # result in a severe and therefore ascertained clinical event.
    socioeconomic_status:
      # SES acts as a proxy for access to healthcare, health insurance, and the ability
      # to seek care without economic hardship, which directly impacts testing behavior.
      high:
        multiplier: 1.10
        sources: [7, 8]
        # Justification: Higher SES is associated with better health insurance coverage
        # and greater access to primary care, which facilitates seeking a diagnosis
        # for COVID-like symptoms.[7] This leads to a slightly higher probability
        # of ascertainment for any given level of illness severity.
      medium:
        multiplier: 1.00
        sources: [8]
        # Justification: Serves as the baseline reference group.
      low:
        multiplier: 0.85
        sources: [7, 8]
        # Justification: Lower SES is associated with systemic barriers to care, including
        # lack of health insurance and inability to take paid sick leave, which can deter
        # individuals from seeking testing for non-severe symptoms.[7]
        # Studies show that areas with lower income and less insurance have lower testing
        # rates per case, indicating suppressed ascertainment.[8] This multiplier
        # adjusts the probability downward to account for these barriers.
    geography:
      # Geographic location serves as a proxy for healthcare infrastructure density
      # and ease of access to diagnostic services.
      urban:
        multiplier: 1.00
        sources: [9, 10]
        # Justification: Urban areas (defined as metropolitan counties) are assumed to
        # have a greater density of hospitals, clinics, and testing sites, reducing
        # logistical barriers to testing.[9] This is set as the baseline.
      rural:
        multiplier: 0.90
        sources: [9, 10]
        # Justification: Rural areas (micropolitan and noncore counties) generally have
        # fewer healthcare facilities per capita and greater travel distances to care.[9]
        # These factors can discourage testing for mild-to-moderate illness, leading to
        # a modest reduction in overall ascertainment probability.[10]
    comorbidity:
      # The presence of certain comorbidities significantly increases the risk of an
      # infection progressing to a severe, highly ascertainable state.
      no_or_low_impact:
        multiplier: 1.00
        sources: [11]
        # Justification: Serves as the baseline for individuals without major
        # risk-amplifying comorbidities.
      medium_impact:
        multiplier: 1.50
        sources: [11, 12]
        # Justification: Represents individuals with conditions that moderately increase
        # the risk of severe COVID-19, such as chronic pulmonary disease (RR of death ~2.6)
        #.[11] The multiplier elevates the probability of ascertainment to reflect
        # this increased risk of a severe outcome.[12]
      high_impact:
        multiplier: 2.20
        sources: [11, 12]
        # Justification: Represents individuals with comorbidities that are strong
        # predictors of severe disease, such as diabetes (RR of death ~6.4) and chronic
        # renal disease (RR of death ~4.3).[11] The large multiplier accounts for the
        # substantially increased likelihood that an infection will become severe and
        # thus be ascertained.[12]
