# ascertainment_parameters.yaml
#
# This file contains the default parameters for the probabilistic case
# ascertainment model. The model calculates a final ascertainment probability
# for each infected agent using a multiplicative formula:
# P_ascertain = P_base(symptoms) * M_age * M_ses * M_geo * M_comorbid
#
# All values are derived from a systematic review of epidemiological literature,
# primarily using COVID-19 as a proxy for respiratory pathogens.

# --- BASE PROBABILITY ---
# Determined by the agent's symptom severity, as this is the single
# most powerful predictor of ascertainment.
# Sources: [1, 6, 34, 2, 3, 7, 8, 23]

  symptom_severity:
    asymptomatic: 0.05
    mild: 0.20
    severe: 0.95 # Includes hospitalized/critical cases

# --- MULTIPLICATIVE MODIFIERS ---
# These values adjust the base probability up or down based on other
# key demographic and clinical factors.

# Age-based modifier. Reflects differences in disease severity and
# testing patterns across age groups.
